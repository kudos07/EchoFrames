 Good morning everyone. Let's get started. The first item on our agenda today is the Q2 sales
 performance. Sarah, can you give us an overview? Yes, absolutely. Compared to Q1, we've seen an
 increase of 12% in total revenue, largely driven by our new product launch. However,
 customer retention dipped slightly, which we need to address. Thanks Sarah. James, what are your
 thoughts on improving retention? I think we should focus more on post-purchase engagement
 and personalized follow-ups. Also, our customer service response time needs improvement.
 That makes sense. Can we have a proposal ready for the next meeting? Yes, I can prepare that.
 Great. The next item is the upcoming marketing campaign. Lisa, can you update us? Sure.
 The campaign will run for six weeks starting next month. Our main channels will be social
 media and email newsletters. We'll also experiment with targeted ads. Sounds good. Make sure to
 coordinate with the sales team so messaging is aligned. Will do. Lastly, let's talk about the
 product roadmap. We are slightly behind on the next software release due to testing delays.
 How long is the delay? About two weeks. We're working to catch up without compromising quality.
 Understood. Please provide weekly updates until release.
 No problem. Alright, if there's nothing else, we'll wrap up here. Thanks everyone.
